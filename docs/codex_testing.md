Please provide the following for tasks 1-3 so codex can review your work

-The task identifier plus the intent (“Task X– description, intent”).
-A quick bullet list of what Cursor says it built or changed (touching code, tests, env/config).
-Any test/dev commands Cursor ran and the claimed results.
-Mention of open questions, TODOs, or known gaps.
-A pointer to new or edited files/paths if they’re not obvious.


Please review the following files for more context on the project:

Codex, please code review Cursor’s Task 12 – “Add payment sync webhook.”
Here’s Cursor’s summary:

I care most about delivering the task goal and high quality acceptance criteria that passes tests. Flag anything risky or missing tests.



cursor task refacotring:

test locally again and if everything looks good send me another refactoring plan for t23-25:


Can the implementation for tasks23-25 be refactored to make it more efficient, easier to maintain, reduce technical debt, Improve Code/file/script Structure and Design, Eliminate Duplicated Code/file/script, consolidate similar Code/file/script, less prone to breaking. Make sure to not change the functionality and keep the behavior identical for all tasks; for anything uncertain, leave a TODO.

send a proposal on how you would do this, but do not make the changes yet

Include the following in your proposal:

-The task identifier plus the intent (“Task X– description, refactoring intent”).
-A quick bullet list of what you want to refactor or change (touching code, tests, env/config).
-Any test/dev commands to run to verify results.
-A pointer to new or edited files/paths if they’re not obvious.
